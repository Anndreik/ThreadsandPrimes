Ex 1 - multiple threads producer-consumer

Write a program with multiple threads.

One thread will generate random numbers (between 100 - 1000) every GEN_TIME. Let's assume that GEN_TIME is 100ms, but it should be easy to change).
Three others threads will wait for a number to be generated by the first thread, will get the number, determine if it is a prime number or not, and print to a log file the following:

Thread <tid>: number <x>, prime: [YES | NO]
